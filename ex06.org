1. Define Boolean functions
   - =is_prime(n)= that tests whether a non-negative integer
     =n= is prime or not.
   - =is_cube(n)= that tests whether number =n= is a perfect
     cube.
   - =is_divisible_by (n, d)= that tests whether an integer =n=
     is divisible by integer =d=.
2. Sort the list of numbers based on their weights, where
   the weight of a number is defined as
   \[
   \text{weight}(n) = \begin{cases}
   3 & n \text{ is prime.}\\
   4 & n \text{ is a multiple of 4 and divisible by 6.}\\
   5 & n \text{ is a pefect cube.}
   \end{cases}
   \]
3. Populate an array =heights[N]= with heights of persons
   and find how many persons are above the average height.
5. Populate a two dimensional array =a[N][N]= with heights
   and weights of persons and compute the Body Mass Index
   (BMI) of the individuals. =a[i][0]= and =a[i][1]= are the
   height and weight of =i= th person.  BMI is defined as
   #
   \[
   \text{BMI} = \cfrac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2}
   \]
   where weight is in kg and height is in m.
